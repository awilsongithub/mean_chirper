   "Description": "Having based their site on a technique I demonstrated in a blog tutorial, in 2012 TIGI International asked me to develop the JavaScript functionality of the TIGI â€“ Hair Reborn website. I used a combination of custom JavaScript and third party jQuery plugins. I also assisted with the HTML & CSS for the desktop version of the site, and wrote a separate stylesheet specifically for the site when being viewed on an iPad.",

   "Testimonial": "Adam is ambitious, responsible, friendly and detail-oriented. He managed the website I designed for First United which was not an easy task. He had to balance the comments and opinions of a variety of people, but always managed to come up with new ideas on how to improve the site. He was a pleasure to work with!",

   "Description": "I led a user-centered redesign of the public website while working as office manager and webmaster for First United Church. I organized a survey of new members regarding the site, reviewed site analytics, consulted staff and engaged a consultant to audit the site. I proposed content updates, consolidation, more multi-media and a streamlined page structure to pastoral staff and was given a week off work to complete the work. Many newcomers to the Church reported their experience with the new site as an important reason for engaging with the Church."
